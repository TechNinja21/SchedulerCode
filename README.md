Hello, thanks for looking at my MIT maker portfolio. 
This repository holds the Scheduler code and all related CAD files.
Attached are instrucions for opening them.

Instructions for opening Scheduler project code:
1. Download and extract the .zip folder or download each .ino file and put them in a folder named "Scheduler_senior_year_getintocollege".

2. Open the "Scheduler_senior_year_getintocollege.ino" file using Arduino IDE, this should display all code in multiple tabs.

Instructions for opening stl files:
1. Download and open "Scheduler3D.stl" in a program of choice or view it in the GitHub stl viewer

Instructions for opening f3d files:
1. Download and open "scheduler v23.f3d" in Autodesk Fusion 360 to view design history.
